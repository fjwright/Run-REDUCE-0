# Run REDUCE

## A Java GUI to run any CLI version of the REDUCE CAS

### Copyright &copy; Dr Francis J. Wright, February 2020

This is the first prototype that does anything useful and my first
ever check-in to GitHub! This GitHub repository is currently
private. I will make it public when I have developed it a bit further.

This version uses the Java Swing library, but at some future date I
will probably switch to using JavaFX. Swing has the advantage that it
is still a standard component of the latest Java SE SDK. I am using
Java 13.

This version only runs on Microsoft Windows, but I plan to add support
for Linux. (Whilst Java is portable, filesystem structures and
installation conventions are not!)

This version only runs PSL REDUCE, but I plan to add support for the
CLI version of CSL REDUCE and probably CL REDUCE.
